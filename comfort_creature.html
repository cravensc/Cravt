    <p>
        Lover, please stay under the duvet. <br>
        It’s too cold out there and too soft in here. <br>
        There are many minutes in the day <br>
        And I’m the only one that really needs you anyway.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Amazing you are, leading me astray <br>
        And I offered nothing but bedded bliss. <br>
        Let me join you in this luxurious bath <br>
        And admire your effort to be up at last. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyone will tell you how great you are <br>
        And that one day your dreams will come true. <br>
        Surely, while you’re doing derivatives or taking out the trash <br>
        They will arrive just for you. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Anxiety and fear need not make you tear. <br>
        Let’s call the sweet slayer of loathe and doubt. <br>
        She can replace hate with love and help us find rest <br>
        So we may never need to bear the weight of success. <br>
    </p>
