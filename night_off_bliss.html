    <h1>A Night Off Bliss</h1>
    <p>
        A kiss for you and you. <br>
        With curly hair braided damp <br>
        Sisters were tucked in by a lavender hue. <br>
        Covered in light from the nightlamp, <br>
        And a blanket the color of a swamp.
    </p>

    <p>
        The wall clock knocked the time <br>
        Telling socked feet to end their roam <br>
        Our chests to raise in rhyme <br>
        And little ears to patiently comb <br>
        Their familiar home for Dad’s ragged metronome.
    </p>

    <p>
        My childhood ear sore <br>
        I can hear it down the hall – <br>
        Yes, even through the door. <br>
        Somehow I miss that great <em>Knaugh</em> <br>
        Slipped from your slack-jawed maw.
    </p>
