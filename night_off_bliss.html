    <h1>A Night Off Bliss</h1>
    <p>
        A kiss for you and you. <br>
        Curly hair braided damp <br>
        Surrounded by a lavender hue. <br>
        Warmed in the light of the nightlamp, <br>
        Awe! Those damn growing cramps!
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyhow, again it was time <br>
        Socked feet end their roam <br>
        And our chests raised in rhyme <br>
        Little ears were left to diligently comb <br>
        Their familiar home for Dad’s ragged metronome.
    </p>

    <p>
        A growl-made ear sore, <br>
        I am still hearing it now – <br>
        Yes, even through the door. <br>
        Nightly we listen to each Great Knaugh <br>
        Slipped from a slack-jawed maw.
    </p>
