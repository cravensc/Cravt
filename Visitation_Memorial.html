    <h1>Visitation & Memorial</h1>
    <p>
        Late arrangements arrived well dressed <br>
        Uselessly placed, to make the place look good. <br>
        Smelling of sorrow? Relief?
    </p>

    <p>
        “He looks good” in his mobster suit <br>
        Pinstriped and shinola black <br>
        Except for those nails they should have clipped.
    </p>

    <p>
        His watch was even still ticking <br>
        Stubbornly holding on for life. <br>
        Too little, too late.
    </p>

     <p>
        Like the Krispy Kreme you demanded <br>
        And the help I knew you needed <br>
        I thought you would still be here when I graduated.
    </p>

    <p>
       You’re the first of the four to go <br>
       So I stood above you and stared <br>
       Even though I knew you would disapprove.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The home weaved a tapestry similar to your son's. <br>
        It came with unraveled ends, broken glasses, missing progeny <br>
        At least they didn't ask me for money.
    </p>

    <p>
        Midland heights keeps getting smaller, sadder. <br>
        Promises of iced oatmeal cookies and red juice<br>
        Must have been the preachers farce.
    </p>

    <p>
        Holy words somehow don’t prohibit <br>
        Sisters snapping over spared shells and engraving indelible texts and <br>
        praying to win pathetic wars.
