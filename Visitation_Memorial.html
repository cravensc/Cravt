    <h1>Visitation & Memorial</h1>
    <p>
        Late arrangements arrived well dressed <br>
        Uselessly placed, to make the place look good. <br>
        Smelling of sorrow? Relief?
    </p>

    <p>
        “He looks good” in his mobster suit <br>
        Pinstriped and shinola black <br>
        Except for those nails they should have clipped.
    </p>

    <p>
        His watch was even still ticking <br>
        Stubbornly holding on for life. <br>
        Too little, too late.
    </p>

    <p>
       The King, sorry for staring and standing above. <br>
       I know you would disapprove. <br>
       I just didn’t know who my Papa was.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The home weaved a tapestry familiar to us now. <br>
        It came with unraveled ends, broken glasses, missing progeny <br>
        At least they didn't ask me for money.
    </p>

    <p>
        Midland heights never reached <br>
        What Mt. Moriah promised with <br>
        Iced oatmeal cookies and red juice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Holy words somehow don’t prohibit <br>
        Sisters snapping over spared shells and engraving indelible texts and <br>
        praying to win pathetic wars.
